This Netlogo model has a lot of options to test various behavioural and spatial phenomena relevant to cycling safety.
It is an extension of a series of existing published models that are loaded here in this git.
There are two models in this Repository - a basic on a more complex version that I recommend you use to build from, and a more complex one that includes aspects of learning and attraction, infrastructure, etc.
